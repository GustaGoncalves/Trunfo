# Trunfo
A small trunfo game I made in C++. First time I used OOP on a program.

As I am now moving to properly learning Object Orientation, I decided to take advantage of a small college assignment to apply some of the basics on a actual program.
Also, if you do not know what trunfo is you can just check the small little in game tutorial about it,
and yes, the cards are based on pokemon and I will not be hearing anything about it.
